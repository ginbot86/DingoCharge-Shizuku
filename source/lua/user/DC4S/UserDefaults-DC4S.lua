       Added charge timeout protection (2022-12-13).
       Fixed issue where resuming session timer counts time while timer was stopped (2022-12-13).
       Added second menu library file due to RAM space exhaustion (2022-12-13).
       Decreased aggressive GC threshold from 16K to 4K but added more forced GCs to mitigate RAM exhaustion (2022-12-13).
1.4.0: Split off monolithic menu library functions into individual files, reducing RAM consumption significantly (2022-12-15).
       Increased aggressive GC threshold from 4K to 16K due to RAM usage savings from modularization (2022-12-15).
       Changed charge error messages to reflect if recovery is enabled (i.e. "paused" vs. "stopped") (2022-12-18).

       Updated copyright string in About screen to read "(C) 2021-2023".
       Changed the default cell count to 2S for improved user experience; most PPS adapters go to 11V so a compatibility fail out of the box kinda sucks... (2023-01-06).
       Changed how aggressive GC is enabled/disabled; set aggressiveGcThreshold to 0 instead of isAggressiveGcEnabled to false (not that you should do this anyway...) (2023-01-08).
       Fixed issue where configuration menu libraries remain resident in memory even when no longer needed (2023-01-21).
       Added LM135/LM235/LM335 support as external temperature sensors (2023-01-21).
       Split off charge control function into a separate file which unloads upon termination to conserve memory (2023-01-27).
       Renamed "DC4S-CompileMenu" to "DC4S-CompileLibs" to reflect that non-menu libraries are also compiled here (2023-01-27).
       Changed how USB-C CC attachment errors are handled; user can retry the detection instead of needing to restart the charge setup procedure (2023-01-28).
1.6.0: Added check to verify battery voltage is at least 3 volts (no PPS adapter will likely support less than this) (2023-01-29).
       Changed how adapter detection works during compatibility test; voltages higher than 5.5V will also trigger an "adapter is not plugged in" message (2023-02-01).

       Lowered the low/high constant-current deadband threshold from 500 to 200mA to reduce charging current oscillation at lower charging rates (2023-05-21).
       Changed external temperature sensor setup exit display to use 'ÂºC' sign instead of just 'C' (2023-07-31).
       Added more system sounds for charge errors and prompts (2023-11-01).

       Fixed issue where the Chg. Set display does not flip between precharge current and voltage once the session timer stops (2023-12-11).
       Added 3.3Vpc charge voltage for LiFePO4 storage (2023-12-11).
       Streamlined charge voltage menu code (2023-12-14).

-- I guess this is easier than trying to build a configuration file parser...
-- Note: as versions are updated, this file should be replaced with one from
--       the latest version, as some new settings may be required. Be sure to
--       copy any non-default settings from the old file to the new one.

function setDefaults()
  -- Main charge parameters.
  -- Number of cells = the number of series cells in the battery pack.
  -- Volts per cell = pack charge voltage / number of cells in series.
  -- Charge current = the charge current used during the constant-current (CC)
  --   charge stage, defined in amps (A).
  -- Termination C rate = termination current / charge current. Typically C/10
  --   or C/20 (0.1C or 0.05C, assuming that the battery is being charged at a
  --   1C rate. Not all batteries can be safely charged at 1C; C/2 is usually
  --   the maximum safe rate, with C/3 or C/5 being other safer rates. Scale up
  --   the termination rate accordingly, if desired.)
  -- Note: many PPS chargers only go up to 11 volts so a 3S Li-ion or higher
  --   config will likely cause a compatibility test attempt to fail.
  --   PPS PDOs of 3.3~5.9V work for 1S, 3.3~11V for 1-2S, 3.3~16V for 1-3S,
  --   3.3~21V for 1-5S, at least for typical Li-ion chemistries. A PPS minimum
  --   voltage of 5V is incompatible with 1S batteries.
  numCells = 2
  voltsPerCell = 4.2
  chargeCurrent = 2
  termCRate = 0.05
end

function setPChgDefaults()
  -- Precharge is only relevant for over-discharged batteries that need extra
  --   care to prevent damage while recovering from undervoltage. The threshold
  --   defines the voltage where the algorithm will transition from precharge
  --   to constant-current mode.
  -- Precharge C rate = precharge current / charge current, assuming the normal
  --   charge current is 1C; see the above notes for more information.)
  voltsPerCellPrecharge = 3
  prechargeCRate = 0.05
end

-- *** Advanced settings below. There is no need to change these settings under
--     normal circumstances. Setting these values to invalid values may result
--     in unpredictable program behaviour. ***

function setRefreshDefaults()
  -- Screen refresh interval will be limited to at least this value, but may be
  --   slower depending on system processing load.
  refreshInterval = 100 -- milliseconds per frame
end

function setDeadbandDefaults()
  -- The charge regulation algorithm will attempt to maintain the measured
  --   current/voltage to +/- [deadband value]. Transitioning from CC to CV
  --   mode is offset by -cvDeadband, and the same applies during precharge.
  --   For example, if cvDeadband is 50 mV, the algorithm will switch when the
  --   voltage is [voltsPerCell * numCells] - 50 mV. This causes a temporary
  --   overshoot in current but is limited in amount and duration (often less
  --   than 10% for a couple minutes), but if it is too high then charging will
  --   fall back to constant-current mode; see setCcFallbackDefaults() below.
  --   This can be helpful when the adapter is unable to fully reach its
  --   maximum reported voltage (in testing, 3 of 3 "21V" capable adapters only
  --   produced 19.95V~20.5V, preventing use with 5S Li-ion packs unless 
  --   4V/cell is selected).
  pcDeadband = 0.01 -- Amps, precharge mode
  ccDeadbandNormal = 0.025 -- Amps, constant-current mode
  ccDeadbandLow = 0.01 -- Amps, constant-current mode for lower currents
  ccDeadbandThreshold = 0.2 -- Amps, use low deadband if current < threshold
  cvDeadband = 0.01 -- Volts, constant-voltage mode
  tcDeadband = 0.01 -- Amps, end-of-charge mode
  
  -- CAUTION: Do not change the rest of the code in this function.
  if (chargeCurrent < ccDeadbandThreshold) then
    ccDeadband = ccDeadbandLow
  else
    ccDeadband = ccDeadbandNormal
  end
end

function setAggressiveGcDefaults()
  -- If enabled, Lua's collectgarbage() will be forced if free RAM is below
  --   this threshold. This check occurs during every charge regulation loop
  --   iteration. (Yes, this is a pretty blunt approach, but it works and it
  --   keeps the system stable...)
  -- Note: Although the option is provided to disable this behaviour, doing
  --   so will severely impact stability (the system will likely hang, or crash
  --   with an out-of-memory dialog within minutes or hours when running the
  --   main charging/UI loop).
  aggressiveGcThreshold = 16384 -- bytes, set to 0 to disable (NOT RECOMMENDED!)
end

function setSystemSoundDefaults()
  -- The Shizuku sound API is used to sound a beep on the splash screen, if a
  --   PD request fails, and when charging is finished (transition from CV to
  --   TC charge stage).
  isSystemSoundsEnabled = true
end

function setCableResistanceDefaults()
  -- The algorithm can compensate for additional cable resistance between the
  --   tester and the battery, which will raise the CC-to-CV threshold voltage
  --   and CV voltage by (current * cableResistance). The algorithm inherently
  --   compensates for resistance and offset from the adapter to the tester
  --   without the need to define it manually.
  -- Note: it is not recommended to overcompensate for downstream resistance
  --   as it poses a risk of damaging the battery through overvoltage. A safe
  --   value is about half of the calculated downstream resistance:
  --   cableResistance = (Vbus_meter - Vbat) / Icharge
  cableResistance = 0
end

function setCcFallbackDefaults()
  -- The algorithm can protect against excessive current draw when the charge
  --   stage moves from constant-current (CC) to constant-voltage (CV) mode. If
  --   the current flow exceeds (ccFallbackRate * chargeCurrent) then the stage
  --   is sent back to CC mode from CV mode.
  ccFallbackRate = 1.1
end

function setTemperatureDisplayDefaults()
  -- During charging, DingoCharge displays the system temperature in the
  --   MiscInfo section. The Lua API provides temperature in Celsius, but this
  --   can be converted to Fahrenheit for locales that use it (e.g. USA).
  isTempDisplayF = false
end

function setExternalTemperatureDefaults()
  -- The algorithm can stop charging if an external temperature sensor on the
  --   D+ pin (for example, a TMP35/LM35, TMP36/LM50 or TMP37) exceeds a preset
  --   threshold, and optionally resume charging once the temperature problem
  --   subsides. Hysteresis prevents the algorithm from oscillating in and out
  --   of a temperature fault state too quickly.
  -- Note: Only the TMP36/LM50 are capable of measuring below temperatures
  --   below freezing (0 degrees C/32 degrees F), since they have a +0.5 volt
  --   offset that puts cold temperatures in range of the Shizuku's D+ pin ADC
  --   (0 to 3.3V). The TMP35/LM35/TMP37 will be unable to provide negative
  --   temperature readings, and therefore will not be able to trigger the
  --   undertemperature protection features.
  isExternalTemperatureEnabled = false -- false disables all temperature protections
  externalTemperatureOffsetVoltage = -0.5 -- 0V for TMP35/TMP37, -0.5V for TMP36, -2.7315 for LM135/LM235/LM335
  externalTemperatureGain = 100 -- 100x for 10mV/degC (TMP35, TMP36), 50x for 20mV/degC (TMP37)

  temperatureProtectionHysteresisC = 10 -- temperature must cool down/warm up past the protection threshold before charge resumes
  isOvertemperatureEnabled = true -- only if isExternalTemperatureEnabled is true
  isOvertemperatureRecoveryEnabled = true
  overtemperatureThresholdC = 50 -- if external temperature is greater than this value, stop charging
  
  isUndertemperatureEnabled = true -- only if isExternalTemperatureEnabled is true
  isUndertemperatureRecoveryEnabled = true
  undertemperatureThresholdC = 0 -- if external temperature is less than this value, stop charging
end

function setTimeLimitDefaults()
  -- The algorithm can stop charging if the process takes too long. Setting the
  --   time limit to 0 will disable timeout protection, as will setting the
  --   charge termination rate to 0.
  timeLimitHours = 24 -- set to 0 to disable
end

  -- This function is called upon program initialization. All of the referenced
  --   functions above must be called here to ensure all settings are applied
  --   during startup.
